# Vroom
The custom compiler for SNext, heavily based off of Leopard, but modified to suit SNext's needs.

## Why does this exist?? Just use Leopard!
Well, you see, we *did* use Leopard. The problem is, though, it doesn't really work for our purposes. So, what we're doing is taking Leopard, modifying it to suit our needs, and putting it in this repo. Pretty neat, eh? 

## Why should I use this over Leopard?
We're;
- more user-friendly
- we have more documentation (something that others lack)
- in plain JS, so it's more friendly to Node (bye bye unreadable code)
- constantly adding new features!
This inhouse tool is being released to the masses, 'cause we think that something like this shouldn't be locked away.
